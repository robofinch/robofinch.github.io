# SlimeFighter
A Rust-based implementation of a video game I made in high school. I've written versions of it (in
various states of completion) in TI-Nspire BASIC, JavaScript, Java, and now Rust. SlimeFighter is a
simple RPG set in a 2D pseudorandomly-generated world with a variety of slimes across ten climates,
as well as many structures, including towers that house powerful golems. The player, who is a golem,
aims to conquer the world by fighting slimes and other golems.

This version has yet to reach a minimum playable state; many features haven't been implemented.
